# Tycho

The year, 2061. You, a shape shifting reptilian overlord, have spent centuries undetected by humanity. You've manipulated the masses, taken down governments, and even to this day, control the minds of billions from your base. Largely unbeknownst to humanity, the moon is not all that it seems. It is your home, your tactical base, and mind control mechanism. Today, you have finally been discovered by humankind. It is up to you, to uphold centuries of mass control, and destroy the human invaders. Defend your moon base, and defeat The Supreme Laser of Death (tm) before it destroys all you hold dear.

Tycho is a game for the 
[Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) game jam. It is developed
in Pico-8 by Patrick Messina and Deejay Paredi. This is our first game 
jam (and first game) and our first time developing on the Pico-8 system. 

The game can be played on itch [Tycho](https://barddevelopment.itch.io/tycho).

We used the following as resources for learning how to develop on this system:

* [laxy devs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdT68dsulMFouI2InvXWM5w) for learning about particles (even though they are necer used)
* [Nerdy Teachers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMjF_cWciuBUZjILNL1fyA) for basic
  game usage, was used to get started on the platformer
* [Boxface - a simple platform setup](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27749) for
  better code organization / usage of tables and collision learning lua
* [Jonas Tyroller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_p_9arduPuxM8DHTGIuSOg)
  for telling us why our platformer sucks and how to fix it.
