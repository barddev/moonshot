# Moonshot

Moonshot is a placeholder title for a game being developed for 
[Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020). It is being developed 
in Pico-8 by Patrick Messina and Deejay Paredi. This is our first game 
jam and our first time developing on the Pico-8 system.

We used the following as resources for learning how to develop on this system:

* [Nerdy Teachers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMjF_cWciuBUZjILNL1fyA) for basic
  game usage, was used to get started on the platformer
* [Boxface - a simple platform setup](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27749) for
  better code organization / usage of tables and collision.
